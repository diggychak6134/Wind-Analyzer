# Wind Energy Analyzer

A Python-based tool to estimate wind energy potential and analyze wind turbine performance based on wind speed data and turbine parameters.

## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating wind energy output by applying standard wind power equations and basic turbine characteristics. The tool helps in understanding how wind speed variations affect power generation and overall energy potential.

## Features
- Wind power calculation based on wind speed
- Analysis of turbine performance characteristics
- Visualization of power curves
- Comparison of different wind conditions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Use Case
The project is intended for educational and analytical purposes, such as:
- Studying wind energy potential
- Understanding turbine behavior
- Supporting renewable energy assessments

## Notes
This project emphasizes applied energy analysis and system-level understanding rather than detailed aerodynamic modeling.
